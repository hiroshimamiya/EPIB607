cdf


The probability that an adult male will be 6 feet tall or shorter is 0.853745. Equivalently, you can say that a 6â€™ tall adult male is at the 85.4th percentile.

X = rnorm(1000) # X is a sample of 100 normally distributed random variables

P = ecdf(X)    # P is a function giving the empirical CDF of X
P(0.0)         # This returns the empirical CDF at zero (should be close to 0.5)
plot(P)        # Draws a plot of the empirical CDF (see below)


z = seq(-3, 3, by=0.001)
p = P(z)
