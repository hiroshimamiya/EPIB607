# Instructor and TA information   
**Hiroshi Mamiya PhD**  
Names of TA and graders will be availalbe in course slides (first day) and in MyCourses. 


# Course information 
**Restriction(s)**: Open to students who have not completed an intro statistics course in applied health science.

## Prerequisites
Being in the first year of an M.Sc or Ph.D. in the Epidemiology, Public Health, or Occupational Health program, or having permission from the instructor if you are from other departments and like to learn applied biostatistics.   
**EPIB 507 and EPIB 521 are the primary alternative to this course, for studnets outside the EBOH Department.**    

While not required, basic skills in statistical programming (preferably R statistical software) are critical, as the course uses a large number of analysis and visualization examples using R statistical software. Students are suggested to take the companion course EPIB613, Intro to Statistical Software.    

Also, ability to use a hand calculator, and basic understanding in arithmetic operations are needed. 





## Learning Objectives
The aim of this course is to provide students with basic principles of statistical inference applicable to study design and data analysis in population health science;   

- Understand how statistical methods are used in research papers and news media and thus evaluate their validity and credibility  
-  Apply statistical methods in your own research,   
-  Effectively communicate quantitative results from your analysis 
-  Use the methods learned in this course as a foundation for more advanced biostatistics and epidemiology courses.  


## Course time and location
8:35AM - 10:25AM, Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
Education Building 129
Aug 29, 2024 - Dec 04, 2024

Exam dates and location are available in course slides and MyCourses.    
**Lectures will be recorded** and will be provided to those who unable to attend the class due to circumstances beyond thier control (e.g., urgent travel, medically related absence, etc).    
**Classes will be in-person, unless weather and buildingin conditions make in-person teaching challlenging e.g., ice or snowstorm. In such case, Zoom address will be provided for virtual class**

### TA office hours   
The Teaching Assistants (TAs) are your first point of contact for questions about the course
materials. Weekly office hours will be offered weekly in-person by the TAs (Dates and time will be available in MyCourses and Course Slides). There will be a few exceptions to the schedule/location of office hours, and these will be posted on myCourses and course slides.

### Email   
When sending an email about booking time, clarification of assignments, and questions about the course materials, please include in the subject heading (EPIB-607 – Inferential Statistics). It will be primarily the responsibility of the TAs to respond to emails and every effort will be made to respond as soon as possible. Please be aware responses to emails received on weekends may be delayed. For questions related to assignments and exams, remember to email well in advance of the due dates. Please be sure to only use your McGill institutional email for communications with the instructor and the TAs - we may not be able to respond to non-Mcgill email address.  


# Reading materials and lectures 
Class notes are available through MyCourses. If you do not have a personal computer to access the electronic materials (mainly myCourses), please get in touch with the instructor. 
In addition to class notes, I will also upload
-  Assignments 
-  Exam and assignment solutions. 
-  Supplementary reading questions. 
-  Questions commonly raised by students.


## Recommended textbook 
*Introduction to the Practice of Statistics Tenth  Edition* (2021) 
By David S. Moore; George P. McCabe; Bruce Craig   
https://store.macmillanlearning.com/ca/product/Introduction-to-the-Practice-of-Statistics/p/1319244440

1-term of e-book purchase entitles students to 6 months access to our Achieve platform, but they are able to download the e-book for 4 years.

**Optional e-book (free)**
*OpenIntroStatistics Fourth Edition* (2019) 
By David Diez, Mine C¸ etinkaya-Rundel, Christopher D Barr     
https://www.openintro.org/book/os/    
and the pdf version is here    
https://www.openintro.org/go/?id=os4_for_screen_readers&referrer=/book/os/index.php     



## Required equipment
  - A calculator with square root, log and exponential functions, to be used during the exams. 
  - A computer or table to access materials in myCourses. 



## Software
There will be in-class illustrations using R Studio software.    
Many examples contain R codes and public data so that you can replicate the analysis. The codes are avaialble in: https://github.com/hiroshimamiya/EPIB607/tree/main/Codes  
but also often pasted to lecture slides.   

However, this course focuses on the concept and application of Biostatistics, and the programming part is covered by EPIB 613.   




# Grading Scheme
Assignment | Grade | Date
-----------|-------|------------------------
Five or six Assignment  |20%| Every few weeks
Mid-term exam* | 30% or 0% | TBA (likely October 24, 2024)
Final exam |50% or 80% | TBA (liekly December 10, 2024)
Total	| 100% 

*Midterm may not be part of the final grade, if the final exam gives higher score. Conversely, if the final exam is low in score such that mid-term can push the final grade up, I will add the score from the mid-term into the final grade. 

The midterm will be held in class (2 hours). 
The final will be held in class (3 hours). 

The Midterm and final exams are in-person. You are allowed to bring a cheatsheet (1 page double sided, A4 size) and calculator. You are not allowed to bring your laptop, smartphone, nor textbook.   



**Assignments (20%)**: There will be 5 assignments during the term.       
 - Assignments must be uploaded to myCourses as a **pdf** before the specified date/time due.         
- Please do not upload assignment in the Microsoft Word Format, or as JPEG or any format other than PDF. Assignments uploaded in any format other than a pdf will not be marked.         
 - Assignments do not have to be completed in R markdown format. You can use word application as long as they are legible and converted into a pdf document. Late assignments will not be accepted, unless discussed with the instructor well before the due date (see Accomodation below).         
 - The purpose of the assignments is to make you ready for mid-term and final exams, provide oppotunities to apply lecture materials to a variety of real-world and conceptual problems, to provide feedback on your learning progress, and to identify weakness to be addressed.   
 - While generative AI applications can solve some assignment problems (you need to cite the application in your assignment), the reliance on such application will lead to the challenge in solving exam questions (and thus failur), since access to these applications are not allowed during the exam. 


**Midterm Exam (25%)**. There will be a closed book exam, during class time (2 hours) that will take place in room (TBA). Please arrive at class on time ready to start your exam.     

**Final Exam (50%)**. There will be a closed book 3-hour final exam that will take place during the exam period on room (TBA). The final exam will cover material from the whole course and will be graded by the instructor and the TAs.   
1-page (A4, lettersize) cheatsheet is allowed, on both sides. A calculator is needed.      

**Preperation for exams**
All questions will come from materials and examples and key concepts covered in class and assignments. Therefore, it is critical to work on assignment questions and lecture materials until you have solid grasp.     
There will be a review session before each exam.   


## Accommodations for missed assignments   
If you need to seek accommodation for missing in-course exams and assignments due to medical or non-medical, please discuss the situation with the instructor at least one week before the original assignment due/exam date, with valid and demonstratable reasons. Urgent (within one week) request for accommodation, again with valid and demonstratable reasons, will be handled case-by-case. You are also encouraged to contact the SAA above when requesting any accommodations.    

Deferrals are not permitted for the midterm exam.

# Policy around the use of AI technologies for class assignments
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to create new types of media, including text, images, software codes, sound, and video in response to user prompts (inputs). Many tools exist that use generative AI to create new content. 
Some examples include ChatGPT and Bing.   

Use of these tools to complete assignments and presentations is permitted as part of learning aids, as long as the three conditions are met:    

   1.   Acknowledge the use of these tools. Specifically, you must cite the creator and the tool in your reference section at the end of your assignment and presentations. Instruction for citation, which you may need to familiarize yourself with future course work, publication, and report writing is provided at https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/    

   2.   Revise and check outputs from these tools carefully. In other words, you cannot copy and paste the crude (unedited) outputs from these tools into your assignments or presentation slides, as the raw responses from these tools tend to be flawed.    

   3.   Submit and present any content produced by an artificial intelligence tool and the prompt (or chain of prompts) used to generate the content as an appendix with their assignments. In your presentation, you must also discuss how the tool was (or will be) used to assist in writing and/or slide making, such that other students can be informed with the effective use of these tools.      


Note: While the use of generative AI tools is permitted in this class, many classes and scientific journals do not allow the use of these tools to generate writing (and any audio and visual contents as well as citations), as their raw outputs are often unreliable and may propagate/amplify misinformation, stigma, and stereotypes. Fact checking is critical when using these tools.   


# University regulations and support 
## Inclusiveness   
I strive to provide an inclusive learning environment. However, if you experience barriers to learning in this course or have any impairments that could impediment your learning, do not hesitate to discuss them with me and/or the Student Accessibility & Achievement Register with Student Accessibility and Achievement -SAA (you can register at https://www.mcgill.ca/access-achieve/). Eligibility for SAA is: 
>  Students who are experiencing academic or physical barriers and have a documented disability, mental health condition,chronic health condition, or other impairment. These may be temporary, permanent, or episodic.
> Students with documented disabilities can register at any point in the year, but we recommend registering as early as possible. We encourage students new to McGill to make an appointment before their semester begins.* 

## Language of assessment 
In accordance with McGill University’s Charter of Students’ Rights, students in this course have the 
right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded.

## Honor code 
 Academic integrity is crucial. Therefore, all students must understand the meaning and consequences of plagiarism and other academic offenses under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/ for more information).
