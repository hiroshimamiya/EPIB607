# EPIB 607: Inferential Statistics (4-Credit)
Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health as part of core courses   


# Preamble   
**Student wellness**  
One out of three students in Canada experience some form of mental health issues during their academic journey. If you find yourself facing a mental health challenge or need to talk to someone, please find on- and off-campus resources and support below: 
  - Wellness Hub:  https://pgss.mcgill.ca/en/mental-health-resources    
  - Specific needs for International students: https://www.mcgill.ca/internationalstudents/
  - See "Community Resources" for 24/7/365 support: https://ssmu.ca/resources/mental-health/    
  - Information about available resources in the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences maybe obtained from the Local Wellness Advisors: https://www.mcgill.ca/wellness-hub/local-wellness-advisor-medicine-health-sciences-graduate-students
  
**Land acknowledgment**   
McGill University is located on the unceded territory of the Kanien’keha:ka, which has long served as a site of meeting and exchange amongst Indigenous peoples,  including the Haudenosaunee and Anishinabeg nations. McGill honors, recognizes, and respects these nations as the traditional stewards of the lands and waters on which we meet today


# Course information 
**Restriction(s)**: Open to students who have not completed an intro statistics course in applied health science.

## Prerequisites
Being in the first year of an M.Sc or Ph.D. in the Epidemiology, Public Health, or Occupational Health program, or having permission from the instructor if you are from other departments.      

Basic understanding of Algebra and Calculus is helpful but not required.   

While not required, basic skills in statistical programming (preferably R statistical software) are critical, as the course uses a large number of analysis and visualization examples using R statistical software. Students are strongly suggested to take the companion course EPIB613, Intro to Statistical Software.   

## Learning Objectives
The aim of this course is to provide students with basic principles of statistical inference applicable to clinical and epidemiologic research so that you can; 
(i) Understand how statistical methods are used in research papers and thus evaluate the quality of quantitative health science papers, 
(ii) Apply statistical methods in your own research, 
 effectively communicate quantitative results from your analysis 
(iii) Use the methods learned in this course as a foundation for more advanced biostatistics and epidemiology courses.  


## Course time and location
Friday 8:35AM-10:3PM EST. Lectures are in-person and will be recorded. 
Location: 

## Office ours 
After the class or by appointment. Please email the instructor or TA. 
    
## Reading materials and lectures 
Class notes are available through MyCourses. If you do not have a personal computer to access the materials, please get in touch with the instructor. 

There is no required textbook. However, the lecture will follow the recommended book below but the lecture will follow: 

Introduction to the Practice of Statistics
Tenth  Edition (2021) 
By David S. Moore; George P. McCabe; Bruce Craig


## Software
There will be in-class illustrations using R software.  

## Grading Scheme
Assignment | Grade | Date
-----------|-------|------------------------
Assignment 1-5 |20% or 20%| 
Mid-term exam | 30% or 0% | TBA |
Final exam |40% or 70% | TBA|
Total	| 100%

The midterm will be held in class, (Date TBA), same classroom.
The final will be held, (Date TBA), same classroom.

The Midterm and final exams are in-person. You are allowed to bring a cheatsheet (1 page double sided, A4 size), but not your laptop, smartphone, nor textbook.

# Policy around the use of AI technologies for class assignments
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to create new types of media, including text, images, software codes, sound, and video in response to user prompts (inputs). Many tools exist that use generative AI to create new content. 
Some examples include ChatGPT and Bing (text generation) and Midjourney and DALL-E (image generation).   

Use of these tools to complete assignments and presentations is permitted as part of learning aids, as long as the three conditions are met:    

   1.   Acknowledge the use of these tools. Specifically, you must cite the creator and the tool in your reference section at the end of your assignment and presentations. Instruction for citation, which you may need to familiarize yourself with future course work, publication, and report writing is provided at https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/    

   2.   Revise and check outputs from these tools carefully. In other words, you cannot copy and paste the crude (unedited) outputs from these tools into your assignments or presentation slides, as the raw responses from these tools tend to be flawed.    

   3.   Submit and present any content produced by an artificial intelligence tool and the prompt (or chain of prompts) used to generate the content as an appendix with their assignments. In your presentation, you must also discuss how the tool was (or will be) used to assist in writing and/or slide making, such that other students can be informed with the effective use of these tools.      


Note: While the use of generative AI tools is permitted in this class, many classes and scientific journals do not allow the use of these tools to generate writing (and any audio and visual contents as well as citations), as their raw outputs are often unreliable and may propagate/amplify misinformation, stigma, and stereotypes. Fact checking is critical when using these tools.   


# University regulations and support 
## Inclusiveness   
I strive to provide an inclusive learning environment. However, if you experience barriers to learning in this course or have any impairments that could impediment your learning, do not hesitate to discuss them with me and/or the Student Accessibility & Achievement Register with Student Accessibility and Achievement -SAA (you can register at https://www.mcgill.ca/access-achieve/). Eligibility for SAA is: 
>  Students who are experiencing academic or physical barriers and have a documented disability, mental health condition,chronic health condition, or other impairment. These may be temporary, permanent, or episodic.
> Students with documented disabilities can register at any point in the year, but we recommend registering as early as possible. We encourage students new to McGill to make an appointment before their semester begins.* 


## Accommodations for missed assignments
If you need to seek accommodation for missing in-course exams and assignments, medical or non-medical, please discuss the situation with the instructor at least one week before the original assignment due/exam date, with valid and demonstratable reasons. Urgent (within one week) request for accommodation, again with valid and demonstratable reasons, will be handled case-by-case. You are also encouraged to contact the SAA above when requesting any accommodations. 

Deferrals are not permitted for the midterm exam.


## Language of assessment 
In accordance with McGill University’s Charter of Students’ Rights, students in this course have the 
right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded.

## Honor code 
 Academic integrity is crucial. Therefore, all students must understand the meaning and consequences of plagiarism and other academic offenses under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/ for more information).
